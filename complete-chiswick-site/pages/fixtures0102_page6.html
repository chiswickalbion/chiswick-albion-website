The Albion were up against it versus <b>Hazelhurst A.F.C</b> from the Croydon &amp; District League, but were strong enough to defend well and take their chances for a pleasing victory. Hazelhurst are the current Surrey County Senior Cup winners, and Premier Division champions, and this showed with electric pace and determination. <br>
Hazelhurst like the Albion were blooding new players so both managers were happy enough with the fine display put on by both teams. It was Albion's prolific goalscorer <b>Liam White</b> who opened the scoring after a mistake by the Hazelhurst keeper. With the wind at their backs Hazelhurst pushed forward for the equaliser but Adrian Rouco in the Albion goal stood up well. When he was beaten Ben White playing in an <br>
unfamiliar right wing back position cleared off the line. Hazelhurst though were not to be denied and they drew level just before half time. In the second period the Albion took the lead when <b>Robert Dawson</b> powered in an unstoppable free kick. Again Rouco was called into action but he was not to be beaten when Hazelhurst's forwards were clean through. <br>
<b>Craig Vargas</b> made the game safe when Martin Salem picked up a loose ball, and fed Vargas who chipped the on coming keeper with ease. <br>
<br>
<br>
The Albion had fielded a trial side against Chiswick Prolifics Reserves the previous week and were content with a 3-3 draw against the newly formed side from Chiswick. <b>Adam White, Chris Allam </b>and <b>Marcus Frost</b> were the men on target for the Albion</font></p>
