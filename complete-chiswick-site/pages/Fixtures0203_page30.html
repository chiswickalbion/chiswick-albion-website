</font></center><p></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">A 3-3 draw was a fair result in the Steve Way Memorial Trophy, played out by the present Championship winning Albion side, and a mix of Albion veterans, managed by Martin Francis. Steve Way Albion's keeper of 30 years ago, died tragically in 2000, whilst playing for a German village team, and this memorial match is played annually in respect of this Albion stopper. The Albion started well and chances fell for them, but none were converted. The vets though full of Albion Legends of yesteryear were not to be outdone and Lee Channell hit the crossbar and also failed to finish a one-on-one with stand-in Albion keeper Robert Dawson. Albion then broke away and Karl Velinor's pace was too much for the old boy's and <b>Liam White </b>made it 1-0 from his cross. Dave Byrnes then crossed and <b>Roy Gadsby </b>rolled back the years with a bullet header for 1-1. Dean Francis was then clear, although he managed to hit a post, when it looked easier to score, as Albion failed to over power the Vets.<br>
The second half was a footballing lesson for the youngster's as the Vets turned on the style. <b>Lee Channell </b>broke through to give the Vets the edge, before Phil Heggie pushed over <b>Liam White</b>, who picked himself up to put away the resulting penalty. <b>Channell </b>again burst clear to put the Vets in charge. But with time running out Dave Gaffney's shot was parried to <b>Liam White</b> who completed his hat-trick. Billy Fleming should have given the trophy to the Vets , but fired over from a few yards out.<br>
Honours even, and the Albion will have learnt a few lessons from this strong Albion Vets squad, for the future.<u><br>
