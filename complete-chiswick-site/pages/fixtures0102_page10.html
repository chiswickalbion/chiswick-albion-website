Chiswick Albion progressed into the semi-final of the Middlesex Premier Cup in extra time, against the holders Beavers FC.&nbsp; Beavers in fact were unbeaten in County matches for four years having won the Premier cup for the last two years, and before that winning the Intermediate version. The Albion was down to just eleven fit players due to injuries and work commitments. <br>
Both <b>Dani Rouco</b> and <b>Anthony Clarke</b> were out, so prolific goalscorer Liam White moved back into midfield, and he put in an inspired display. This left what must be the youngest strike force at this level, with two sixteen year olds<b> Adam White</b> and Karl Velinor. As the saying goes if you're good enough your old enough, and this came true as both terrorised the Beavers defence. <br>
Both sides set about each other and both sides missed a couple of half chances. Beavers broke the deadlock when <b>Simon Lamb</b> chased a long through ball and tucked it past <b>Adrian Rouco</b> Albion's new No 1. The wind behind Beavers back bought about another goal for <b>Lamb</b>, who looped his shot over Rouco. In the early part of the season Albion would have folded, but with both Phil Heggie and <b>Sammy Boyd</b> back in the side, they have bought about a new belief for the youngsters. First <b>Richard Ralph</b> then Adam White both came close to pulling a goal back. <br>
The second half was more productive for the Albion, and with the wind now at their backs, Beavers began to struggle. First <b>Velinor</b> chipped the keeper from 20 yards, and when <b>Liam White</b> was chopped down in the box, he picked himself up to send the resulting penalty beyond the Beavers keepers grasp for 2-2. Beavers though are not County champions for nothing and <b>Scott Bridgeman</b> scored a beauty through a crowd of players, to put Beavers in front again. <br>
But the Albion was not to be denied, and <b>Dean Francis</b> tucked away a <b>Martin Salem</b> in swinging free kick, to take the tie into extra time. Both sets of players were physically drained, but <b>Heggie</b> who had moved to a more forward position due to a knock, pulled off one of the sweetest of lobs with five minutes to go for <br>
Albion's winner. Albion now meet Belstone from the Marathon League on the 24<sup>th</sup> March at home in the semi final</font></p>
