</font><font face="Arial" size="3">Chiswick Albion dominated this Upper Supplementary Cup match from the off, and chances came at regular intervals. Parkside Wanderers from Division One were outclassed by their Premier rivals, as the score line suggests. Adam White had an early chance, before <b>Dean Francis</b> opened the scoring with the aid of a Dani Rouco cross. <b>Rouco</b> himself fired in number two through a crowd of players, for his first Albion goal. Parkside did create a few chances themselves, but just lacked the final touch. This was not the case for the Albion, and <b>Liam White</b> tucked the ball away for 3-0. <br>
Following a Sammy Boyd corner, <b>Anthony Clarke </b>made it 4-0 as the ball was not cleared<b> </b>from the crowded area.<b> Adam White</b> latched onto a poor back pass to round the keeper for a comfortable half time score. It was much the same in the second period as Albion put Wanderers to the sword. First <b>Adam White</b> raced through and finished from a tight angle, and big brother Liam carved out chance after chance for himself, but just could not pass Wanderers array of different goalkeepers. Ben White almost made it a family affair, but headed just wide from the most acute of angles. The best goal came when Liam White passed to Rouco, and his inch perfect cross was headed home by the tenacious <b>Boyd</b>. The Albion were now rampant and following a Rouco corner, <b>Clarke </b>scored his second. <br>
<b>Liam White</b> then scored from the edge of the box, before <b>Liam White </b>picked <br>
himself up after one of his surging runs, to tuck away the resulting penalty he had earned himself. This was his twenty-first goal in sixteen appearances this term, with hopefully plenty more to come. Liam White then turned provider for the last goal gleefully tapped in by <b>Sammy Boyd</b>, and a convincing win.</font></p>
