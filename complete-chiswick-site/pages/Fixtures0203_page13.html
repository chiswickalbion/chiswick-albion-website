Chiswick Albion made it seven wins from seven played in the West Middlesex Premier <br>
Division to remain top of the table after defeating mid-table Meadhurst Sunday 10-1. <br>
The Albion started well and a surging run down the left flank by Adam White saw his <br>
cross-converted at the far post by <b>Dean Francis</b>. <b>Adam White</b> had a couple of chances he spurned, until with the help of Vojin Soskic he made it 2-0. The Albion then created a <br>
wonderful goal from their own goal-line, and with most of the team involved, transferred the ball to the other end of the pitch where <b>Liam White</b> turned it in.<br>
The second half was a lot easier as Chiswick scored at will. First <b>Robert Dawson</b> was on hand to turn in Dani Rouco's cross. Meadhurst then picked up on a defensive mistake to take their only real chance of the match.&nbsp; This spurred on Chiswick and <b>Liam White</b> put away Rouco's cross. Another cross this time by Dawson found young striker <b>Adam White</b> alone at the far post to head in. <b>Dawson </b>then completed his hat trick with two quick goals, one with his right foot, as Meadhurst fell apart. Defender <b>Vojin Soskic</b> ran half the length of the pitch to convert number nine, and <b>Dani Rouco</b> completed the rout with a simple header.<br>
A two-week League winter break leaves the Albion closing in on four fronts, and a big 2003 is anticipated. <br>
