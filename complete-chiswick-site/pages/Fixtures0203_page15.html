Chiswick Albion remain top of the West Middlesex Premier Division table, but they needed a late winner from <b>Karl Velinor</b> to see off a spirited The Rising Sun. Albion started slowly and it was the Sun who pressed early on. Somewhat against the run of play Vojin Soskic crossed and <b>Dean Francis</b> playing up front in place of the injured Adam White slammed home from close in. Then a threaded pass from <b>Anthony Clarke </b>picked out <b>Liam White</b> and the prolific goalscorer scored his 16<sup>th</sup> of the season. The Albion were now in command and <b>Robert Dawson</b> from fully 40 yards hit a sweet free-kick that was just kept out by Sun's keeper, who also repelled White's <br>
follow up shot. Just before half time the Sun pulled a goal back when Danny Allen who had been a constant threat all game, beat the linesman and Albion defence to reduce the arrears.<br>
The Albion got off to the perfect start in the second period when Francis crossed <b>Alan Sime </b>shot; hit the keeper out to White who hit the post, and back to Sime who this time converted for 3-1. Just as the Albion looked to press on for more goals themselves, a mistake in the defence <br>
allowed the lively Sun's forwards to earn themselves a penalty that was duly converted. The Sun were now on top and had a wicked shot, which hit the crossbar only to bounce clear. An uneasy Albion defence then conceded again with a well-taken goal and it was back to 3-3. Time was ripe to bring on the 18-year-old Karl Velinor as the side was reshuffled. White earned himself a free kick on the edge of the box, and struck it well enough, only for the keeper to fumble it, and up popped that man <b>Velinor</b> with the faintest of touches to score the winner for the second week on the trot.<br>
The Rising Sun gave this young Albion outfit a difficult match, but in the end the Albion were just about worthy winners.<br>
