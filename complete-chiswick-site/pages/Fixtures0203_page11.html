Chiswick Albion won three valuable points against a hard working Hampton Village side, and remain in the leading pack at the top end of the table. Albion started well and went close on a couple of occasions, but failed to make the breakthrough. This came when Liam White created a chance for himself and slotted into the bottom <br>
corner. A goalkeeping crisis on the morning of the match, with both <b>Peter Sousa</b> and <b>Adrian Rouco</b> both out of action, forced manager <b>Mark White</b> into selecting right back Dave Gaffney between the sticks. This looked to have been a poor choice as he fumbled a corner, and then was caught off his line by Sean Kelly from 30 yards for Village's equaliser. Both <b>Robert Dawson</b> and <b>Dani Rouco</b> both were just off target, as was Alan Sime who played a neat one two with Adam White. This was soon <br>
rectified when <b>Liam White</b> showed great determination and sent the ball to <b>Alan Sime</b> who converted this time. <b>Adam White</b> then picked up a ball from Dawson on his chest went around the defender and keeper for a 3-1 half time lead.<br>
The second half was much the same, chances missed and another gaff from Gaffney who was this time stuck on his line when a defensive header back to him let in Paul Drakes who finished well. This was a wake up call, and straight away <b>Adam White</b> scored for a 4-2 advantage. <b>Richard Ralph</b> then crossed and Adam White side footed home for his second successive hat-trick. Albion was now on a roll and <b>Vojin Soskic</b> volleyed home a beauty with his right foot, usually only used to stand on. The goal of the game came when <b>Dani Rouco</b> crashed in Dawson's corner that went in like a rocket.<br>
