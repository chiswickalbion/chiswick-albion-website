</font></center><p></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Chiswick Albion recorded a remarkable league double victory over top of the table Domine Athletic in what was a thriller. The hosts started brightly and put the Albion back line under early pressure but <b>Vojin Soskic</b> and <b>Paul Sime</b> coped well. But then it was the Albion's turn to mount some pressure with some neat inter-play and triangles in the midfield. Their pressure paid off and <b>Dean Francis </b>nutmegged his marker and thumped a superb curling 25 yard drive into the top corner for his first goal this season. Albion then doubled their lead when <b>Adam White</b> roasted the full back to set up <b>Karl Velinor</b> who close range effort was saved, however the rebound fell kindly to Albion's skipper <b>Liam White</b> and he fired home. Then Domine took control off the game but a superb <b>Peter Sousa</b> save from a low drive and a deflected effort that struck the cross bar meant Albion held on to half time.<br>
The second half saw the hosts come out flying and the Albion defence was put under real pressure with Ben White making a fine block from a viscous drive. However, the breakthrough did come when a high cross from a corner was met by Darren Smith to head home. But Albion came back and a cool finish from the young striker Karl Velinor put the visitors three one ahead. The game then turned around again as Domine hit two goals to draw level and leave for a frantic finish. The predatory instincts of Johnny <br>
Ruggins supplying both the goals. Then came the winner when <b>Robert Dawson</b> linked up with <b>Alan Sime </b>and Dawson let fly an unstoppable drive from 25 yards into the roof of the net to claim all three points for the Albion. Desperate defending saw the Albion out to the final whistle and complete a great feat in securing the double over Domine. A <br>
special mention must go to <b>Adam White</b> for his hard work and perseverance as the youngster once again terrorised the Domine back four and nearly scored himself but for a superb save. The Albion now sit at the top end of the table and face league leaders Hillingdon Cricket Club next week which is a huge game for both clubs.<br>
