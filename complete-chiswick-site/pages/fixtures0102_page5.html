Chiswick Albion progressed into the quarterfinals of the Middlesex Sunday <br>
Premier Cup with a comfortable victory over Harrow Weald Memorial. Memorial currently top of the Harrow Challenge League started well but Phil Heggie and Paul Harris were in commanding form at the back. It was Harris who created the first goal when he beat the offside trap only for his shot to rebound of the keeper into the path of <b>Ben White</b> who side footed coolly into the unguarded net. <br>
Ben White then had a goal bound header knocked off the line following a Dave Gaffney corner. From another Gaffney corner <b>Liam White</b> cleverly flicked in number two and Memorial gave up the chase. The difference in the <br>
standards of the two leagues became apparent as the Albion ripped through at will, and Rob Ursell should have increased the lead but shot at the keeper when in the clear. He soon made up for this when Peter Sousa kicked clear and a poor defensive header went to <b>Ursell</b> who this time shot into the bottom <br>
corner. <br>
Dean Francis finished strong and went close a couple of times. Ursell hit a post and Liam White shot just over as the Albion turned up the heat. Against the run of play Memorial hit a late consolation but the Albion were by then already <br>
looking forward to the new years meeting with either Rangers F.C or Indian Gymkhana for a place in the Semi-final.</font></p>
