</font></center><p></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">On paper this look like a comfortable first round Middlesex Premier Cup match, but it did not turn out to be so for Chiswick Albion. The Albion are challenging for honours in the West Middlesex SFL against Manor Town bottom of the North Hillingdon League, with only one league point. The Albion were also last season's semi-finalist in this cup, against a side making their debut in the competition. Trouble was Town did not read the script and after Town's keeper made a double save from Liam White, they pressed forward <br>
themselves looking for the opener. The Albion were always on top though, but could not find the back of the net. Adam White went close from a Robert Dawson cross. Following a short corner again Dawson's effort was saved low down. Although Town's forwards were lively they did not threaten to score until Martin Salem protecting his face was adjudged to have handled and Town converted the penalty although Peter Sousa made a brave effort to save it. Dani Rouco and Dawson blasted over, and it looked like one of those days. This may have been so but the Albion have <b>Adam White</b>, and this 17 years old is heading for greater things. A mazy run into the box past three defenders and a fine finish looked the fillip Albion needed. Not so as Town smashed home from 25 yards giving Sousa no chance. Again <b>Adam White</b> skipped through challenges and slotted in the equaliser, showing great finesse in doing so. <br>
In extra time <b>Dean Francis</b> headed home Dawson's cross for 3-2 almost on the restart, but Town would not give up, and a free header from a corner beat Sousa for 3-3. Adam White was causing havoc in Town box and just failed with a header from Rouco's corner. Another identical run and finish from <b>Adam White</b> put the Albion in front once again, but just the same as before Town came back and a speculative shot-cum-cross which <br>
deceived Sousa and dropped in at the far post. The winner came when <b>Liam White</b> <br>
miscued a shot which hit a defender and looped over the stranded keeper and the Albion now go on to play Boxtree Pub in round 2, who are bottom of the Harrow Challenge League. Oh no!<br>
