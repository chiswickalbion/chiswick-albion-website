Chiswick Albion progressed to the quarterfinal of the Middlesex Premier Cup at the expense of Mercury Waltham side Percival. Percival are currently top of their Premier Division, whilst the Albion are mid table in theirs. The differences in the standards of the League were obvious as the West London side <br>
dominated for long periods, without making the breakthrough they deserved. <br>
Percival controversially opened the scoring against the run of play, but a dogged Albion was eventually not to be denied. <b>Anthony Clarke</b> passed to Liam White whose shot was well saved by Hayes the Percival keeper. Another good effort this time from<b> Martin Salem</b>, set up by Adam White kept Hayes on his toes. <b>Richard Ralph</b> then put in Adam White but his shot was just wide. The chances kept coming and <b>Ritchie Griffin</b> was inches wide with a header following a corner by Richard Ralph. <br>
As soon as the second half started Liam White made a great run into the box, crossed and Adam White shot over from close in. <br>
<b>Adam White</b> had tormented the Percival defence all game, and received his just desserts when he ran clear to bring the teams level, on the hour mark. <br>
A Percival midfielder was sent off for head butting the tenacious <b>Sammy Boyd</b>, back for at his best, controlling the midfield, and even more openings then appeared. Ralph again reached the goal line and pulled the ball back to <b>Liam White</b>, and he made no mistake from six yards out. <br>
With five minutes to go a penalty was awarded to Percival, which was <br>
converted after a re-take when <b>Adrian Rouco</b> had saved the first effort. <br>
The Albion were not fazed and pushed on for the winner, and prolific goalscorer <b>Liam White</b> scored two goals in quick succession to kill off <br>
Percival, and land another Albion hat trick.<br>
If the Albion can bring this form to their League programme one can expects an upward movement in the table.</font></p>
