The West Middlesex Sunday League is assured a finalist in the prestigious Middlesex County <br>
Premier cup after Chiswick Albion joined fellow league side Domine Athletic into a tasty looking semi-final. Domine dispatched Hillingdon Cricket Club 3-0, but Chiswick needed extra-time to <br>
defeat North Hillingdon League side Technicolor Sunday 4-3. <br>
The Albion were soon out the traps and <b>Adam White</b> made a strong run down the left, cut inside and shot, only for the ball to hit the keeper Chris Fermie into the path of <b>Liam White</b> who smashed home in the first minute. This seemed to affect the game as Tech took control and the Albion sat back defending deep. Tech carved out a number of chances but failed to convert, which cost them dear in the long run. Somehow the Albion defence held Tech out, and <b>Paul Sime</b> and <b>Vojin Soskic</b> were always on hand for a last ditched tackle. <b>Peter Sousa</b> in the Albion goal was also in fine form as Tech looked to equalise.<br>
The Albion were better in the second period, and Adam White went close on a couple of occasions, but to be fair to Tech it was poor finishing that let them down. A couple of substitutions by Tech brought about the equaliser, as Sousa pulled out a great save only for the ball to fall to the forward who made no mistake. Tech then took the lead with fifteen minutes remaining, and Albion looked out. Albion though had won ten matches in a row and would not give up. This was apparent as Liam White burst through the defence and was fouled on the edge of the box. Up stepped free kick <br>
specialist <b>Robert Dawson</b> to bend the ball around the wall into the top corner for 2-2 and extra time. The more youthful Albion side were now getting stronger and Dawson picked out <b>Alan Sime</b> to head home close in from a sweet free kick. <b>Karl Velinor</b> replaced Vojin Soskic who had <br>
dislocated his arm in a tackle, and made no mistake when Adam White set him up for a header for a 4-2 advantage. Tech were now almost out of it but summoned up one more big effort and scored with five minutes remaining, to set up a frantic finish. Albion though held on as they showed great <br>
character when things were not going their way, and look forward to a titanic game against one of the best Sunday sides around.<br>
