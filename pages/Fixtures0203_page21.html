Chiswick Albion progressed to the quarter-finals of the Edmondson Premier Cup after <br>
defeating Intermediate Division side Draytonians in extra-time. Draytonians were fired up from the start, but Albion were also up for it, and Adam White and Anthony Clarke both carved out early chances. The Albion made an early breakthrough when Martin Salem chased down a lost cause, won the ball and teed up <b>Liam White</b> who picked his spot for <br>
1-0. Draytonians were adopting the more direct approach with a huge wind at their backs, and this tactic was paying dividends, but for last ditch defending from Paul Sime and Vojin <br>
Soskic. Draytonians did draw level from a corner after keeper Peter Sousa saved, but after a scramble the ball was thumped home. Draytonians then took a shock lead over their <br>
Premier rivals against the run of play, as on the stroke of half time, they scored with a quick breakaway goal.<br>
Early in the second period <b>Robert Dawson</b> curled in a free kick into the top corner to draw the teams level. Then <b>Dawson</b> Albion's free-kick specialist put the Albion in front from <br>
another exquisite free kick after Adam White was felled. Draytonians summoned up one last effort towards the end and took the tie into extra-time scoring with five minutes to go. As Draytonians tired in extra-time, a shot from Liam White fell to Dawson who tucked away for his hat-trick. More chances came and went as Albion failed to kill off Draytonians, one being when Clarke hit a post after Karl Velinor had set him up. <br>
