Both sets of players put in a sound performance in this Premier Division encounter at the White Lodge.&nbsp; The Albion got of to a good start and Liam White went close.&nbsp; An early goal was vital for the Albion, and it duly came when Adam White turned his defender who bought him down in the box for a penalty. Up stepped big brother <b>Liam </b>who gave Crowder no chance from the spot. <br>
The Albion though was unable to keep this lead and following a throw in and a cross <b>Anthony Eggington</b> blasted home from close in.&nbsp; A great strike from <b>Sammy Boyd</b> was too hot to handle for Crowder but he recovered well to turn away Adam White's follow up effort.&nbsp; <br>
<b>Peter Sousa</b> back in the Albion goal for the first time since October did well after a shaky start as the confidence came flooding back.This he had to be as <br>
Stanwell pushed on looking for a top four finish in the Division.&nbsp; <br>
This was also on the minds of the Albion, but Stanwell were not easy to break down and their central defender <b>Frost</b> was at the heart of most of this<b>.&nbsp; Anthony Clarke</b> now playing his best football for the Albion went close, as did <b>Rob Ursell</b>.&nbsp; From an Ursell corner Liam White's glancing header flew just over. Stanwell <br>
themselves maybe should have scored but their forward line did not take the chances created.&nbsp; The Albion almost snatched the winner in the closing minutes as <b>Karl Velinor</b> hit the crossbar following a corner. This was probably just as both sides deserved a point out of a hard fought contest well refereed by Andy Davies.&nbsp; Albion next week has a last chance of glory in the Upper Supplementary Cup against Hampton Village.&nbsp; <br>
The winner will play the following week in the final against The Rising Sun.</font></p>
