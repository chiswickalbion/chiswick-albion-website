<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="3">Chiswick Albion's return to form coincided with their return to the neat passing game that has served them so well this season. After a shaky first ten minutes, Albion dominated the play and scored at will. <b>Adam White</b> the youngest of the three White brothers made no <br>
mistake when Martin Salem's persistence paid off, and he crossed for him to score close in. Mead's replied soon after, but <b>Alan Sime</b> powered home Liam White's cross for a 2-1 <br>
advantage. Albion turned the screw now, and from a roll out by Peter Sousa, the Albion keeper, the ball travelled right through the team up to the Mead's box and <b>Dean Francis</b> gleefully converted. <b>Anthony Clarke</b> was then on hand to convert another sweeping Albion move as Mead's struggled to cope. Meadhurst fielded a young side, and will need time to gel, just as the Albion did themselves a couple of season's ago. <b>Liam White </b>compounded Mead's misery just before half time after a one two with Adam White.<br>
The second period was much the same and Richard Ralph burst through and was on for his first goal in 46 appearances but shot tamely at Cook in Mead's goal. <b>Adam White</b> did better from Liam White's pass to put the game beyond Meadhurst coolly finding the bottom <br>
corner. <b>Alan Sime</b> scored with a free header from Ralph's out swinging corner, before <b>Ben White</b> provided the icing on the cake for the White family when he volleyed home Alan Sime's short pass. This being only the second time all three brothers had scored in the same match. This win confirmed Albion's position at the head of the league table level with Domine Athletic, although the Albion has three games in hand on them.<br>
