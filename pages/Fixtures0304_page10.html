The West Middlesex SFL were worthy winners of the Rose Bowl in this annual contest against the Morrells Oxford SF League. Oxford adapted a lot quicker than Middlesex and put them under a lot of early pressure. This was well defended by James Roberts (Beavers) and a disciplined back four. Harvey Stillman (Chiswick Albion) looked <br>
comfortable in goal against Oxford's marauding young forward line, and his handling gave West Middlesex confidence. After Oxford's early raids West Middlesex look more positive and Adam Willis (Barnes Albion), Jason Laws (Beavers) and Robert Dawson (Chiswick Albion) set up a few chances for the forwards. After a series of corners from Dawson, including one that struck the crossbar, an alert Dave Harding (Barnes Albion) curled in a beauty from 25 yards for the opener. <br>
West Middlesex in the second period started to dominate, but Oxford to their credit equalised from a cross unfortunately turned his own goal by the otherwise impressive Roberts. West Middlesex upped the pace again and Simon Lamb (Beavers) chased down a lumbering defender, nicked the ball, shot, but could only hit the post. Luckily for West Middlesex the ball dropped to Liam White (Chiswick Albion), and he was felled in the box by the confused Oxford keeper. Adam Willis claimed the ball in front of a queue of would be penalty takers and found the bottom right hand corner of the net. Willis just before this had burst through, but allowed the keeper to grab the ball when Dawson was in a good position square of him. Never mind, West Middlesex were now creating all the chances and Lamb blasted over from close in. On came Adam White (Chiswick Albion) and he made an immediate impact, scooting past two defenders <br>
before squeezing the ball home from just inside the six-yard box. Manager Mick Cox once again had put a decent side together, although he had been hampered by <br>
injuries, the late call ups did not let him down. <br>
The competition that started in 1982, is now dominated by WMSFL and they have held the trophy since 1998.<br>
