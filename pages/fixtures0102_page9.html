<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="3">At last the Albion kept a clean sheet as the defence plays tight and with true grit to keep out Meadhurst Sunday, and earn a very useful three points. Both sides were quick off the blocks, but the Albion carved out the better chances. First Liam White fired wide when Anthony Clarke crossed, then his little brother Adam White pulled out a good save from the Meads keeper after Martin Salem worked the left flank and put over a good cross. <br>
Liam White shot just wide from close in as the strong wind at their backs drove Albion forward. Then Sammy Boyd teed up Phil Heggie but again the ball went wide. So no goals at the interval, and facing gale force winds, the Albion looked to have blown their chance as Meads adopted the long ball approach. This did cause moments for Meads, but Albion's keeper Adrian Rouco was in a <br>
determined mood, and gave Meads little chance.&nbsp; A couple of iffy challenges in the Meads boxed went unpunished, until <b>Liam White</b> was pulled down, and he picked himself up to convert the resulting penalty. <br>
Phil Heggie then hit a post, and Adam White ran Meads defence in the last quarter to shreds, but nobody got on the end of the chances this brave little striker supplied. As the game wore on Meads looked dangerous, but the Albion were not to be passed and held on for the spoils.</font></p>
